# My Portfolio 
This application is simple and has all my project I worked on.
## Discryption
In this app you can find a bit about me and what I do. Navigation is easy and links are functional.
## functinality
Scroll box was added by doing a google search and getting the synthax. 
Was very challenging to set up flex box. 
Box hover was added to meet the requirement of scaling when hover. 
Media Query was added max with 500px. 
Some image was taken to show progress. will be uplaoded after push to github.
